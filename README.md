## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A Google account for OAuth setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edgar12233/nestjs-api-i18n-auth-starter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd nestjs-api-i18n-auth-starter
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or 

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables. Here's a sample configuration:

   ```env
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

2. Replace the placeholders with your actual Google OAuth credentials and a secret for JWT.

## Usage

To start the application, run:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

or 

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

The application will run on `http://localhost:3000`. You can modify the port in the configuration if needed.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- **POST /auth/login**: Login with Google OAuth.
- **GET /auth/logout**: Logout the current user.

### Internationalization

- **GET /i18n/:lang**: Get translations for the specified language.

### Validation

- **POST /validate**: Validate incoming data against defined schemas.

## Testing

To run tests, use:

```bash
npm run test
```

or 

```bash
yarn test
```

This will execute the test suite and provide you with a report of the results.
